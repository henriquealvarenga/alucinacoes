The main tenet of the HVM is the notion that hearing voices is a meaningful human experience, and in this article, we discuss the historical growth and influence of the HVM before considering the implications of its values for research and practice in relation to voice-hearing. Among other recommendations, we suggest that the involvement of voice-hearers in research and a greater use of narrative and qualitative approaches are essential. Challenges for implementing user-led research are identified, and avenues for future developments are discussed.},

In each study, 31 hallucinators and 31 nonhallucinators were selected based on scores from the Verbal Hallucination Questionnaire (Barrett \& Etheridge, 1992). In Study 1, subjects completed the Betts QMI Vividness of Imagery Scale. In Study 2, each individual completed a Control of Imagery Questionnaire. The results suggested that verbal hallucinators have more vivid imagery than nonhallucinators, but not better control of their images. It was suggested that vivid imagery may be one of the factors underlying reports of hallucinations by individuals in the general population.}

Here we report an episode of isolated high-altitude psychosis. It consisted of a “third person” phenomenon involving 2 sensory modalities: somesthetic (felt presence) and visual (the light of 2 flashlights) hallucinations. This episode occurred in a highly experienced climber when he was at an altitude of approximately 7500 m while descending at dusk from the summit of Gasherbrum I (8068 m). The symptoms lasted approximately 3 h and had fully resolved on reaching high camp (7150 m). No other physical or mental symptoms were reported. In addition to hypoxia, a number of other risk factors could have contributed to the occurrence of psychosis in this climber. These included sleep deprivation, exhaustion, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, reduced visibility, feeling of isolation, and perceived danger. The climber has participated in many extreme altitude expeditions, and neither before nor since this episode has the climber experienced psychotic symptoms.}

All but one subject reported somesthetic illusions (distortions of body scheme) as well as visual and auditory pseudohallucinations.

The experience is frequently interpreted as a sign of psychiatric symptomatology, whereas it is not only quite common in such situations but may in fact be an adaptive reaction. It can be conveniently described in terms of Jaynes's (1976) theory of bicamerality, but its specific etiology and characteristics have not been adequately investigated.}

How did this happen? One has to look at the history of changing meanings related to the cult of Our Lady of Fátima, its integrative energy, and the global spread of the cult. The fact that, most recently, immigrants with Hindu and Muslim background are also among the pilgrims to Fátima speaks of the unpredictable cross-cultural and cross-religious possibilities of this cult, in which gender aspects of a female deity play an important role. This paper will analyze the various periods of the cult from its beginning in 1917 and the roles of secularism, the Salazar regime, Colonialism, the Cold War, and migration from and (later) to Portugal, in order to find insights into a fascinating global cult and how it has changed and adapted to a society that has developed a new attitude towards traditional Catholicism. While the history of the Cult of Fátima has been studied before, this article seeks to introduce a global and, at the same time, long-term historical perspective.}
