	abstract     = {In 1917, in the context of extreme anxiety of a rural Catholic population during a period of war, revolutionary upheaval, and anticlerical politics, the apparition of St Mary to three children near the Portuguese village of Fátima stirred up emotions that have created a cult that is still attracting hundreds of thousands of pilgrims each year and that has found followers all over the world. How did this happen? One has to look at the history of changing meanings related to the cult of Our Lady of Fátima, its integrative energy, and the global spread of the cult. The fact that, most recently, immigrants with Hindu and Muslim background are also among the pilgrims to Fátima speaks of the unpredictable cross-cultural and cross-religious possibilities of this cult, in which gender aspects of a female deity play an important role. This paper will analyze the various periods of the cult from its beginning in 1917 and the roles of secularism, the Salazar regime, Colonialism, the Cold War, and migration from and (later) to Portugal, in order to find insights into a fascinating global cult and how it has changed and adapted to a society that has developed a new attitude towards traditional Catholicism. While the history of the Cult of Fátima has been studied before, this article seeks to introduce a global and, at the same time, long-term historical perspective.}

		One-hundred and thirty-six university students were administered the

In each study, 31 hallucinators and 31 nonhallucinators were selected based on scores from the Verbal Hallucination Questionnaire (Barrett \& Etheridge, 1992). In Study 1, subjects completed the Betts QMI Vividness of Imagery Scale. In Study 2, each individual completed a Control of Imagery Questionnaire. The results suggested that verbal hallucinators have more vivid imagery than nonhallucinators, but not better control of their images. It was suggested that vivid imagery may be one of the factors underlying reports of hallucinations by individuals in the general population.}

Principal components analysis was performed on the data. Four factors were obtained loading on items reflecting (1) sleep-related hallucinatory experiences (2) vivid daydreams (3) intrusive thoughts or realness of thought and (4) auditory hallucinations.

We also examined the relationship between the presence of hallucinatory experiences and other factors, such as substance use and social desirability. Two hundred and thirty-six nonclinical participants completed a modified version of the LSHS, a social desirability scale, and answered followup questions. Factor analysis of the present version of the LSHS revealed a five-factor structure. Results regarding participants' hallucination frequency, perceived levels of control, and affective responses are reported. Additional results and implications are discussed.},

Also, the association between personality structure and hallucinations remains poorly investigated. The aims of the present study were twofold. First, to explore the influence of age on the prevalence of hallucination-proneness, and second, to examine the association between personality and hallucination-proneness in young and elderly subjects. A sample of young (n=230) and elderly adults (n=183) completed an elaborated and validated version of the Launay–Slade Hallucinations Scale (LSHS; Larøi, Marczewski, & Van der Linden, 2004) and the Five Factor Inventory version of the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa, & McCrae, 1992). Differences were found between elderly and young subjects depending on the type of hallucination. Analyses of associations between personality domains and hallucination-proneness revealed differing associations for the young and elderly groups. For the young sample, there were significant associations between LSHS-scores and Openness to Experience and Neuroticism domains. For elderly subjects, only the Openness to Experience domain was significantly associated with LSHS-scores. Furthermore, in the young sample, Neuroticism was significantly associated with the presence of both auditory hallucinations and vivid daydreaming.}

  abstract  = {While auditory hallucinations are considered a core psychotic symptom, central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, it has long been recognized that persons who are not psychotic may also hear voices. There is an entrenched clinical belief that distinctions can be made between these groups, typically, on the basis of the perceived location or the 'third-person' perspective of the voices. While it is generally believed that such characteristics of voices have significant clinical implications, and are important in the differential diagnosis between dissociative and psychotic disorders, there is no research evidence in support of this. Voices heard by persons diagnosed schizophrenic appear to be indistinguishable, on the basis of their experienced characteristics, from voices heard by persons with dissociative disorders or by persons with no mental disorder at all. On this and other bases outlined in this article, we argue that hearing voices should be considered a dissociative experience, which under some conditions may have pathological consequences. In other words, we believe that, while voices may occur in the context of a psychotic disorder, they should not be considered a psychotic symptom.},

It is unclear whether these hallucinations occur as an isolated phenomenon or if AVH in nonclinical individuals are part of a more general susceptibility to schizophrenia. For this study, 103 healthy individuals with frequent AVH were compared with 60 controls matched for sex, age, and education. All participants were examined by a psychiatrist using standardized diagnostic interviews and questionnaires. The individuals with AVH did not have clinically defined delusions, disorganization, or negative or catatonic symptoms, nor did they meet criteria for cluster A personality disorder. However, their global level of functioning was lower than in the controls and there was a pronounced increase on all subclusters of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Peters Delusion Inventory, indicating a general increased schizotypal and delusional tendency in the hallucinating subjects. History of childhood trauma and family history of axis I disorders were also more prevalent in these individuals. We showed that higher SPQ scores, lower education, and higher family loading for psychiatric disorders, but not presence of AVH, were associated with lower global functioning. Our data suggest that AVH in otherwise healthy individuals are not an isolated phenomenon but part of a general vulnerability for schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The international Hearing Voices Movement (HVM) is a prominent mental health service-user/survivor movement that promotes the needs and perspectives of experts by experience in the phenomenon of hearing voices (auditory verbal hallucinations). The main tenet of the HVM is the notion that hearing voices is a meaningful human experience, and in this article, we discuss the historical growth and influence of the HVM before considering the implications of its values for research and practice in relation to voice-hearing. Among other recommendations, we suggest that the involvement of voice-hearers in research and a greater use of narrative and qualitative approaches are essential. Challenges for implementing user-led research are identified, and avenues for future developments are discussed.},

This method capitalizes on the absence of confounding factors that typically affect the study of hallucinations in clinical subjects. Aim - To estimate the prevalence of HLEs in young adults; validate the mutidimensionality and explore the correlates of latent HLEs clusters. Methods - Cross-sectional survey design. The extended 16-item Launay–Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS-E) and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were administered to 649 Italian college students (males: 47%). Confirmatory factorial analysis was used to test multidimensionality of the LSHS-E. Hierarchical nested, progressively constrained models were used to assess configural, metric and scalar invariance of the LSHS-E. Latent class analysis was used to test the existence of different profiles of responding across the identified hallucination-proneness dimensions. Results - Factor analysis showed that the four-factor model had the best fit. Factors were invariant across demographic variables and levels of psychological distress. Three latent classes were found: a large class with no HLEs (70% of participants), a multisensory HLEs class (18.8%), and a high hallucination-proneness class (11%). Among those reporting high levels of HLEs, approximately half reported scores indicative of considerable psychological distress. Conclusions - Although HLEs have a relatively high prevalence in the general population, the majority of those experiences happen in isolation and are not associated to psychological distress. Approximately half of those individuals experiencing high levels of HLEs report significant psychological distress. This may be indicative of general risk for mental health conditions rather than specific risk for psychosis.}

Nonetheless, the lifetime incidence of psychotic experiences among individuals in the general population has been repeatedly estimated to be greater than 5\% across large international samples. Many affected individuals do not seek psychiatric help and yet report experiences remarkably similar to those seen in classically defined psychosis, with some notable and informative exceptions.},

Here we report an episode of isolated high-altitude psychosis. It consisted of a “third person” phenomenon involving 2 sensory modalities: somesthetic (felt presence) and visual (the light of 2 flashlights) hallucinations. This episode occurred in a highly experienced climber when he was at an altitude of approximately 7500 m while descending at dusk from the summit of Gasherbrum I (8068 m). The symptoms lasted approximately 3 h and had fully resolved on reaching high camp (7150 m). No other physical or mental symptoms were reported. In addition to hypoxia, a number of other risk factors could have contributed to the occurrence of psychosis in this climber. These included sleep deprivation, exhaustion, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, reduced visibility, feeling of isolation, and perceived danger. The climber has participated in many extreme altitude expeditions, and neither before nor since this episode has the climber experienced psychotic symptoms.}

In this paper, we review historical perspectives on VH, exploring factors that led VH to be classified as a core symptom of schizophrenia in the late 20th century. Around the same time, an alternative paradigm emerged through the Hearing Voices Movement, which argued that VH was a variation of normal human consciousness that should be accepted and explored without stigma. Dirk Corstens, a psychiatrist working within that perspective, joined forces with Andrew Moskowitz, a clinical psychologist with experience with dissociative disorders, to publish a paper entitled ‘Auditory Hallucinations: Psychotic Symptom or Dissociative Experience’? In that seminal paper, Moskowitz and Corstens (2007) argued—after reviewing research on VH in the general population, similarities in VH between clinical and non-clinical populations, and the relationship between dissociation and voice hearing—that VH was better understood as essentially normal and dissociative in nature, rather than pathological and psychotic. They further argued that voice hearers would benefit from dialogical approaches seeking to understand the purpose of their voices and change the voice hearer's relationship to them. Since then, research and clinical trials have strongly supported all the tenets of the 2007 paper, to the point that relational or dialogical approaches to VH are now rapidly becoming an acceptable complement or even alternative to medical treatment for hearing voices.}

  abstract  = {Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging data was used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying auditory-verbal and visual hallucinations (AVHs and VHs). Consistent activation across studies during AVHs, but not VHs, in Wernicke's and Broca's areas is consistent with involvement of speech and language processes in the experience of hearing voices when none are present. Similarly, greater activity in auditory cortex during AVHs and in visual cortex during VHs supports models proposing over-stimulation of sensory cortices in the generation of these perceptual anomalies. Activation across studies in the medial temporal lobe highlights a role for memory intrusions in the provision of content for AVHs, whereas insula activation may relate to the involvement of awareness and self-representation. Finally, activation in the paracingulate region of medial prefrontal cortex during AVHs is consistent with models implicating reality monitoring impairment in the misattribution of self-generated information as externally perceived. In the light of the results, the need for unified theoretical frameworks that account for the full range of hallucinatory experiences is discussed.},

	abstract     = {Ratings of grief reactions, post-bereavement hallucinations and illusions and quality of life were made during the first year after the death of a spouse among 14 men and 36 women in their early seventies. In both sexes, the reactions were generally moderate or mild and characterized by loneliness, low mood, fatigue, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctioning. Feeling lonely was the most persistent problem during the year. Post-bereavement hallucinations or illusions were very frequent and considered helpful. Half of the subjects felt the presence of the deceased (illusions); about one third reported seeing, hearing and talking to the deceased (hallucinations). Former marital harmony was found to make a person more prone to loneliness, crying and hallucinations or illusions. The quality of life was significantly lower among the bereaved than among married people and those who never married, but equalled that found among divorcees.}
